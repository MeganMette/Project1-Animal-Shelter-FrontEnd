            Welcome to the Yorkshire Animal Shelter.
            <br>
            Here at the shelter work tirelessly to campaign against animal cruelty. We rely on the support of all our staff,
            volunteers and most importantly you to help us push for changes in the law.
            This will help to improve the legal standards around the welfare of animals on farms, in labs, in the wild, in paddocks or our homes.
            <br>
            Through vigorous investigations and prosecutions we stand up to all those who deliberately harm animals
            in order to send out a clear message that we will <b>NOT</b> tolerate animal abuse.
            We have a team of highly trained officers who are always ready to tackle cases of neglect
            and cruelty on every level.
            <br>
            <br>
            <u>We are working to stamp out animal cruelty all together.</u>
            <br>
            <br>
            All animals will be able to rely on us to:
            <ul>
                <li>Rescue them when they need us most</li>
                <li>To rehabilitate them wherever possible</li>
                <li>Provide them with the very best veterinary care</li>
                <li>To find them new homes, either through rehoming or release back into the wild</li>
            </ul>
            We urge you to adopt a pet me have in our care. There is a standard fee of Â£300 which goes towards 
            the care for all our animals to receive a little gift for each adoption that takes place.
            We find that providing the animals in our care a little treat as often as we can, it helps to rehabilitate
            them and train them.
